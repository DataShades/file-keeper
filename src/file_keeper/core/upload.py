        Use this property if you want to read the file ahead, to get CSV column
        names, list of files inside ZIP, EXIF metadata. If you get `None` from
        it, stream does not support seeking and you won't be able to rewind
        cursor to the beginning of the file after reading something.

        Example:
            ```python
            upload = make_upload(...)
