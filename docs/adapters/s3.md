# AWS S3 Adapter

The `file_keeper:s3` adapter allows you to use Amazon S3 for storing and retrieving files. This adapter leverages the `boto3` Python library.

## Overview

This adapter provides a convenient way to integrate AWS S3 with File Keeper. You'll need to have the `boto3` library installed (`pip install boto3`) and configure it with the appropriate credentials for your AWS account.

## Initialization Example

Here's an example of how to initialize the S3 adapter:

```python
from file_keeper import make_storage

storage = make_storage("my_s3_storage", {
    "type": "file_keeper:s3",
    "bucket": "your-s3-bucket-name",  # Replace with your S3 bucket name
    "region": "your-aws-region",  # Replace with your AWS region (e.g., us-east-1)
    "access_key_id": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID",  # Replace with your AWS access key ID
    "secret_access_key": "YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",  # Replace with your AWS secret access key
})

# Now you can use the 'storage' object to upload, download, and manage files.
```

**Important Notes:**

*   Replace the placeholder values (bucket, region, access\_key\_id, secret\_access\_key) with your actual AWS account credentials and configuration.
*   Ensure that you have created a bucket in your AWS S3 account to store the files.
*   For enhanced security, consider using IAM roles instead of hardcoding access keys.
*   Refer to the [AWS S3 documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for more information about AWS S3.
