# AWS S3 Adapter

The `file_keeper:s3` adapter allows you to use [Amazon
S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for storing and retrieving files. This adapter
leverages the `boto3` Python library.

## Overview

This adapter provides a convenient way to integrate AWS S3 with
file-keeper. You'll need to have the `boto3` library installed and configure it
with the appropriate credentials for your AWS account.

```sh
pip install 'file-keeper[s3]'

## or

pip install boto3
```


## Initialization Example

Here's an example of how to initialize the S3 adapter:

=== "AWS S3"

    ```py
    storage = make_storage("my_s3_storage", {
        "type": "file_keeper:s3",
        "key": "***",
        "secret": "***",
        "bucket": "file-keeper",
        "initialize": True,
    })

    ```

=== "MinIO"

    ```python
    storage = make_storage("my_s3_storage", {
        "type": "file_keeper:s3",
        "key": "minioadmin",
        "secret": "minioadmin",
        "bucket": "file-keeper",
        "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:9000/",
        "initialize": True,
    })
    ```


**Important Notes:**

*   Replace the placeholder values (bucket, region, access\_key\_id,
    secret\_access\_key) with your actual AWS account credentials and
    configuration.
*   Ensure that you have created a bucket in your AWS S3 account to store the
    files.
*   For enhanced security, consider using IAM roles instead of hardcoding
    access keys.
*   Refer to the [AWS S3 documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for more
    information about AWS S3.
